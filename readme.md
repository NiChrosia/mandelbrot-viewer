# Mandelbrot viewer

To run, call `nim r main.nim` while in the directory. This will run the file using Nim.
This does require installing Nim.

## Controls

As the controls were largely created to play around with the set, they're a bit odd.

WASD - move camera (still a bit off, they don't feel as they should)

\[-=\] - control iteration level (- is lower, = is higher)

\[scroll\] - control zoom level (scroll down to zoomer in)
