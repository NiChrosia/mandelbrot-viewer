# Mandelbrot viewer

To run, call `nim r main.nim` while in the directory. This requires installing Nim, which can be done at https://nim-lang.org/.

## Controls

As the controls were largely created to play around with the set, they're a bit odd.
| name | key | description |
| - | - | - |
| camera movement | WASD | W, up, A, left, etc. |
| zoom level | scroll wheel | scrolling down zooms in |
| iterations | -, = | - decreases, = increases |
